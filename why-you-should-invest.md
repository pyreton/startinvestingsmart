# Why You Should Invest

![Beach](/assets/img/beach-with-logs.jpg)

[46% of U.S. residents aren’t investing today](http://www.gallup.com/poll/147206/stock-market-investments-lowest-1999.aspx). For whatever reason, they don’t think they should invest in the stock market. Maybe they think that investing requires a lot of money (it doesn’t) or that it requires paying financial advisor to help you invest ([it doesn’t](/myth-investing-is-hard-work)).

But if you can’t escape the feeling that you’re not going anywhere financially, you might start wondering if you should invest. Investing, once you really boil it down, is simply putting your money to work returning more money back to you. It’s all about increasing your financial net worth, and meeting long-term financial goals.

Most of us have jobs, where we trade our time for money. The core concept of investment that should motivate you to take the time to set up your investment is this: your money can be working for you while you’re off doing something else, whether that’s at your job, on vacation, or even sleeping!

You can think of money that you’ve invested as employees of your own, tirelessly working for you to earn you more money.

##Goal

Of course, money is not the end goal in and of itself. What money *can* do is provide you economic security:

- Peace of mind knowing that you can handle an emergency (job loss, car damage)
- Comfortable retirement (most people think of retirement in old age, but if you have enough invested, you could retire earlier)

Ready to get started? Great! There’s good news and bad news.

The bad news is that it does take a bit of work to understand your financial situation and have excess money to invest each month.

The good news is that once you have a bit of money set aside each month, the rest is easy! Despite what some would have you believe, investing does not require a ton of research. In fact, if you follow simple steps to get set up, the less you check on it, the better you’ll do!
