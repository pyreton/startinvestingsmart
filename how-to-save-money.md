## To save money, Change the way you think about money

If you want to save money, you need first to think like an investor, not a consumer.

Once you have the investor’s mindset, there are two things you can do to save money each month: 
- you can either spend less money, or 
- earn more money.

## How to spend less money

The first step to spending less money is tracking your spending. You can do this simply with a pen and paper that you carry with you or you can use a application that tracks spending (most banks provide a breakdown of your spending).

Once you have tracked where your money is being spent, you want to put them into categories (like “Housing”, “Restaurants”, “Groceries”, etc).

Then, order your spending with the largest categories at the top and go through the list.

Are you surprised by how much you spend on certain things? For example, many people are surprised when they see how much they spend on coffee, it’s only $4 a cup, right? But when you multiply that over a year, that’s $1,460!

For each category, think if there are ways you could cut back a bit. For example, maybe instead of buying starbucks everyday, you can start drinking coffee at the office, which is much cheaper.

- Drive people with your car using the Uber or Lyft app
