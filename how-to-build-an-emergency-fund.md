## Why build an emergency fund?

Could you handle an unexpected bill for $400? If you are in the US, there is nearly a 50% chance that you would not be able to handle it. That is a troubling statistic, especially when considering that most unexpected expenses are over $400.

Before you start investing, you need to use your savings to build an emergency fund to handle all the unexpected emergencies that life can (and will throw your way).
How much should you save in your emergency fund?

Most financial experts agree that you should save enough to cover 3-6 months of your living expenses. This will allow you to cover a period of unemployment if you were to lose your job.
What kind of account should be used for an emergency fund?

This emergency fund should be put in an savings account that will be stable so that you can withdraw from it at a moments notice. Regular bank savings accounts are a great first place to consider. They won’t return a lot, but that’s not the purpose of your emergency fund – it’s purpose is to be there when you need it.

Once you have your emergency fund topped off, you have a solid foundation from which you can start investing for growth.
