# Money doesn't buy happiness

We think getting more money will make us happier. And to a certain extent that’s true: if you’re in poverty and really struggling to get by, more money will help you be less unhappy because basic needs will be met. However, once you reach a certain point (some studies say it’s around $70,000/year) more money doesn’t correlate with happiness.

There are a couple reasons why:

The first is reason is an economic principle called “diminishing returns”. It means for each additional thing you get, the less value it provides. For example, the first bite of ice cream tastes great on a hot day. By the last bite of your seventh bowl, it might actually provide negative value and you might decide not to eat it.

But the more likely reason is a physcological principle called hedonistic adaptation. Sometimes called the hedonistic treadmill. The theory goes that once you attain some new level of comfort, you will eventually adapt and suddenly want to reach a new level of comfort, and take for granted what you have.

Loius CK summarized it very well with his monologue on [“Everything’s Amazing, Nobody’s happy”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLkX2VaQs4)
