# How to save money fast

Sometimes you need to save money fast – a gradual spending reduction plan isn’t going to cut it. Maybe you didn’t have enough of an emergency fund built up and got hit with unexpected bills. Or maybe you just want to put your saving into overdrive to reach an important goal quickly.

## The problem: it’s too easy to spend money

Today’s society is built to make it as easy as possible to spend money – your job puts your paycheck into your checking account, where you can easily spend from it. Credit cards make it easy to spend money you don’t even have!

## The solution: make it harder for yourself to spend money

That might sound crazy: Life is hard enough as it is, why would you want to make anything harder for yourself?

Here’s why: we’re impulsive. If we see something we want, it can be hard to take the long term view and consider the pros and cons rationally. We want it now!

And since swiping a credit card is so easy and quick, there’s no time to think about the purchase. Also with swiping a card, there’s no sense of how much you are spending. Swiping to buy a pack of gum looks the same as swiping to buy $2,000 skis!

### Step 1: Hide your credit cards

If you hide your credit cards, and buy everything with cash, you’ll immediately start saving money fast, because it takes more *work* to use cash: you have go to an ATM to get more, and because you actually *see* how much your spending: handing over $5 feels a whole lot different from handing over $2000!

Some people take this trick to the next level: they literally freeze their credit card in a block of ice in the freezer. That way if they want to use it (maybe to make an online purchase), they have to take it out and let the ice melt. This gives them time to think over the purchase.

### Step 2: Automatically save a portion of your paycheck

There’s one thing easier than thinking about saving money: not thinking about saving money! If you set a portion of your paycheck to automatically go to your saving account (instead of having to remember to transfer it) then you will automatically build up savings and be less tempted to spend it.
