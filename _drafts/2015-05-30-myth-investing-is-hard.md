CNBC has an article where [Jim Cramer gives advice on how to start investing](http://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/21/cramer-basics-how-to-start-investing-your-savings.html)

Let’s break down his advice:

> “Jim Cramer has decided to take a step back, and go back to basics this week to cover the most important aspects of investing. After all, this isn’t an education that you learn in school, so it has to come from Cramer.”

Very true! Personal finance education is sorely lacking in our education system. Let’s get to learning!

> “To begin, you must save enough cash to create a discretionary and retirement account.”

Well that’s a pretty big jump - saving enough is actually the hardest part about starting investing! It is true though, you shouldn’t start investing until you have your personal finance situation in order with a budget, emergency fund, and no high interest debt. Don’t have that yet? [Don’t worry, we have you covered](TODO).

OK, so for aside from skipping the actual hard part about starting investing, his advice is so far on track. Let’s see what he has to say next.

> “Cramer believes that a diversified portfolio of five to 10 individual stocks is the best way to maintain a portfolio.”

WHAT?! Only “Five to 10 individual stocks”??! That advice is so bad it’s almost criminal. A tremendous amount of studies have shown that picking individual stocks is a strategy that underperforms the market on average. Meaning, if you try to pick the right stocks, sometimes you might beat the market, and most of the time the market will beat you.

I can’t believe that for an article titled “How to start investing your savings” (which is clearly aimed at people new to investing) Cramer is advising something so irresponsible.

Surely he has some advice for HOW to pick these mythical 5-10 winners, right? Ah, here we go:

> “To start to pick individual stocks, you need to read the company’s SEC filings. The most important ones are the annual report, known as the 10-K, and the latest quarterly report, called the 10-Q.”

Oh that’s all, just read all the SEC filings, that doesn’t sound too bad. Let’s start alphabetically with AAPL’s 88 page 10-Q. There are full courses taught at MBA programs on how to decipher these filings, and he doesn’t give any clue about how to decipher them? Not very helpful. What’s that? Even if you could understand them, you don’t have time to read one 88 page filing, let alone the filing for every stock you want to research? Neither do I!

Fortunately, there’s no reason to do that because: 
a) it would take too much time and most importantly, and 
b) YOU’RE BETTER OFF INVESTING IN A PASSIVE INDEX FUND. (Read more on the research on Why that is here)

So the good news is once you set up a plan for investing in a passive index fund, you can do like Ron Popiel and [“Set it, and forget it!”](https://youtu.be/tLq27iOW0R0?t=24)
