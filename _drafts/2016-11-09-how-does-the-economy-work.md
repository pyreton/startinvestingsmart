# How does the economy work?

To be a smart investor, it helps to know how the economy works, so you can where it has been, where it is now, and where it will probably be.

So how does the economy work? This video from Ray Dalio is a great primer to understand how the “economic machine” works. In the time it takes to watch an episode of a TV show, you can watch this and have a better grasp of the economy than most people you will meet. It’s another critical part of thinking like an investor, not a consumer.

Specifically, [this video](https://youtu.be/PHe0bXAIuk0) explains how three factors (short term debt cycle, long-term debt cycle, and productivity growth) can be used to understand where the economy is, and where it is probably going.
