Don’t save enough? You are not alone

- 50% of American’s don’t have access to a 401k
- 33% actually set up the 401k
- 11% are saving enough
- 0.5% feel they are saving too much (if this is you – well done!)

The fact is saving is hard for 2 main reasons:

- We know we should do it, but we’ll just do it later. We procrastinate because we’re more focused on the present than the future.
- Because we think in terms of the present, savings feels like a “loss”

So what can we do?

The first thing to do is re-frame savings as an investment in yourself, not a loss suffered today. This is not easy, but if you can adjust your mindset, then saving will come more easily. The second thing you can do is set up systems so that it happens automatically without you thinking about it. Set up an automatic transfer from your paycheck to your savings and investment accounts, so you don’t feel that “loss”.
