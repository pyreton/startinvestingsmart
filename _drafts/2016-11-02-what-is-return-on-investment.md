# What is return on investment?

“Return on investment” (abbreviated “ROI”) is the amount of money generated and *returned* to an investor. It may sound dry, but it is actually the “magic” that let’s you make your money work for you, rather than the other way around.

To calculate return on investment, simply take the money that the investment “made” and divide it by your initial investment. So if you made $500 in one year on a $10,000 investment, that has an ROI of 5%.

Even more “magical” is what happens when returns are used to invest again. Take the example above, where you had a 5% ROI. If you took that $500 and added it to you existing investment of $10,000, giving you a total investment of $10,500. Now if you re-invest it for the 5% return on investment, you’ll make $525 — $25 more than the $500 you made the year before!

This growing return is made possible by something called “Compound interest”. Again, while it may sound overly technical, it is the magic that allows your capital to grow faster and faster over time. It’s a form of “exponential growth” which humans have a hard time wrapping their minds around. But those that do can benefit greatly from the knowledge that the earlier they start receiving return on investment, and then re-investing those returns, the more there money can work for them.
