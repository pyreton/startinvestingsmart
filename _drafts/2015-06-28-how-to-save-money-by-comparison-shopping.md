# How to Save Money By Comparison Shopping

Most people know that competition is good for shoppers because retailers must compete for your business, usually by lowering their prices because people are comparison shopping. For example, I go to store A, check the price of the product I want to buy, then go to store B, and check the price there.

But what happens if you stop comparison shopping and only go to one store? What if lots of people stop comparison shopping?

## A Story of Laundry Detergent

One day, I ran out of laundry detergent. Out of habit, I turned to Amazon.com to buy a replacement bottle of Seventh Generation Laundry detergent.

When I pulled it up, I was surprised at the cost: $23 seemed high. But, it was 100oz which sounds like a lot. Still, it was high enough for me to wonder…

Those prices must be for smaller bottles, right? No way Amazon’s prices are almost 100% higher, right?

Actually, they are. Amazon charges $23.00 for the same bottle of detergent that Target sells for $11.69. That’s almost double, and I almost paid it. Luckily, I did a 2 second Google search to comparison shop.

## The Moral of the Story: Comparison Shopping can Save You Money

In negotiations, there is a term called BATNA. It means “Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement”. Basically, your next best option. In this case, Amazon was betting that I would be too lazy to search quickly on Google to see if there are better prices. Because I did, I got a better alternative and saved some money.

The fact that Amazon is able to charge so much more tells me that enough people don’t comparison shop, and as a result, Amazon is confident in their strategy.

I hope you will now think twice before blindly buying from a site before doing some quick shopping around. I know I will.
