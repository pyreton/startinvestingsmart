# Risk vs Return

## “Nothing ventured, nothing gained”

“Risk versus Return” refers to the close relationship between the two. You can’t make money from investments without accepting some risk. In order to make money (a.ka. “returns”) an investor has to be comfortable with the amount of uncertainty (a.k.a. “risk”) that goes with it. In general, the higher the expected return from an investment, the higher the risk.
## Seeing the Relationship between Risk Versus Return

We can visualize this relationship by plotting a range of investment opportunities in terms of Risk (on the x-axis) versus expected return (on the y-axis):

Notice how investments with higher risk have the chance for higher returns. It’s important to point out that the higher risk means there is a higher chance the investment could be wiped out completely.
## Short term versus long term investments

Each investment account you have should have different goals and properties. On one extreme is your emergency fund, and on the other is a long-term retirement goal.

The emergency fund needs to be ready at a moment’s notice, and you want to be certain that it’s going to be there. So you invest your emergency fund in an account that will have as close to zero risk as possible. This means that it will also have close zero returns – it won’t grow over time. But that’s OK for the emergency fund’s goals.

On the other end of the spectrum is a long-term retirement account. Since a retirement account needs to have enough money to support you, it needs to be pretty large by the time you retire. So you want it to grow.  Since it is years in the future, you don’t need it immediately, so some uncertainty is OK, as long as we expect it to grow over the long term. That ability to take on short term risk is good, because we’ll need it in order to have a chance at returns.
