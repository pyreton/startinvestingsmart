# What is a mutual fund?

A mutual fund is a security (something you can buy or sell) that is usually a bundle of stocks. That way you can just buy one mutual fund and effectively own many different stocks.
 
## Why mutual funds are a good idea

The primary benefit of mutual funds is that they offer diversification. If you’ve ever heard the expression “don’t put all your eggs in one basket” then you understand the benefit of owning many stocks. If 1 of the companies in your mutual fund goes out of business, then that’s not ideal, but it’s not the end of the world for you. If however, you only had stock in that one company, if it went bankrupt you’d lose your entire investment.

## What to watch out for

There are two kinds of mutual funds: active and passive.

**Passive** mutual funds have managers that only try to mirror the market. For example, a mutual fund that follows the S&P 500 will simply buy and sell in order to own the 500 stocks that are in the S&P 500 (buying more stock of the larger companies, and less of the smaller companies). They’re fees are lower because they are just following the market, and not trying to be fancy.

**Active** mutual funds have managers that actively try to pick the best stocks. Unfortunately, history has shown that on average, managers that try to pick the best stocks usually do worse than the market as a whole did (so it would have been better to own a passive mutual fund that covers the whole market). Because they are actively managed, they require higher fees. So not only do they usually do worse than the market, they charge more too!

 
## Wrapping up

When it comes to investing and making your money work for you (rather that the other way around) passive mutual funds are one of the best options. In particular, Vanguard has made a name for itself by offering low-fee passive mutual funds. They can provide some of the lowest fees because they are investor owned, that means they aren’t trying to make profits off of their investors. That means everyone’s interests are aligned well.
