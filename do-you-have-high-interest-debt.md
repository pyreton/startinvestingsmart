# Do you have any high interest debt?

If you have high interest debt, an investor is looking forward to your interest payments – you are their investment! Worse, you won’t find an investment opportunity that will return more, so you’ll never become an investor until you escape the high interest debt.

High interest debt is any debt with higher interest than what you can find elsewhere (usually in the stock market). As a rule of thumb, any debt with interest over 7% is too high and you should pay it off immediately. Normal examples of high interest debt are credit card balances (it’s OK to use credit cards, just be sure to pay it off each month so you don’t carry a balance) and pay day loans (you should really try to avoid these at all costs).
