# How to pay off high interest debt

Before you can start climbing the mountain of investment, you need to climb out of any pits of debt that are holding you back.

Remember, by exercising the financial strength required to have extra money left over each month, you’ve done the hard part. Now it’s time to get the benefit of all that hard work!

To escape your debt as quickly as possible, it’s important to remember the power of compound interest – the higher the interest on your debt, the more money you are paying. Here is the step by step guide for paying off your debt as fast as possible.

## Step 1. List all your debts

To chart your way out of debt, you need to know what pits you’re climbing out of and how steep the walls are. For each debt you have, list:

- The type of debt (student loan, mortgage, credit card, etc)
- The amount of debt outstanding
- The minimum payment
- The interest rate

While you’re getting all this info together, it’s a good idea to make sure each company that you have a debt with has up to date contact information for you. That way if they need to contact you (for example, if your payment gets somehow lost in the mail) you can be notified as soon as possible.

## Step 2: Pay all the minimums

You must pay all the minimums on your debts, or risk falling into default – you need to avoid that at all costs, as you know, so make sure you have a plan for paying all your minimum payments on time. Automatic bill pay from your bank can be a lot of help here. (Just make sure you always have enough in your checking account to cover the automatic payment.)

## Step 3: Put your left over money each month into the debt with the highest interest rate

Now that you have the minimums covered, you want to put the rest of your left over money each month where it will do the most “work” for you. That’s going to be the debt that has the highest interest rate. Generally these are credit cards and payday loans.

## (Optional) Step 4: Refinance and consolidate your loans

If your financial standing has improved since you acquired your debt (and it should always be improving if you are financially strong!) you may be able to consolidate your loans (this will make managing all your debts easier) and possibly even get a lower interest rate.

Follow these steps for long enough, and you have your best chance for paying off your debts and being ready for the investment climb.
