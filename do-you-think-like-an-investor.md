The very first and most important step to becoming a successful investor is changing from a consumer mentality to an investor mentality.

- A consumer focuses on immediate enjoyment, without regard for future consequences. An investor knows there are future costs & benefits to consider, and makes sure to take them into account when deciding how to spend money right now. (Important note: this doesn’t mean investors don’t have fun – it just means they consider the whole picture first)
- A consumer reacts to what life throws at them, while an investor has a plan for the future and takes action.
- A consumer doesn’t think of money as something that can be put to work to generate more money, an investor does.
